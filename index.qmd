##   Issues with STA 113 2.0 and STA 115 1.0

1. Core Statistical Foundations

<p style="color:blue;">STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics</p>

<p style="color:blue;">STA 115 1.0 Elements of Sampling</p>

2. Applied and Emerging Areas

3. Computational and Programming Skills

4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses


###

<p style="color:blue;">**Issue:** Considerable amount of overlaps</p> <p style="color:blue;">**Suggestions:**<p style="color:blue;"> **Remove** "2. Data Collection" from STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics</p>

<p style="color:blue;">**Introduce a new section**: Forms of Data:  Structured Data, Unstructured Data, Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-Temporal</p>

#

### STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics

1. **Introduction to Statistics**
• Definition of statistics
• Role of statistics in society
• History of statistics, Branches of statistics
• Scope and limitations of statistics
• Terminology used in statistics

2. **Data Collection**
• Steps of data collection
• Observational and experimental studies
• Primary and secondary data
• Population and sample
• Sampling
• Methods of collecting data


3. **Exploring, Summarization and Presentation of Data**
• Types of data
• Scales of measurements
• Exploring data (one way and two-way frequency tables, box plots, stem and leaf plots, histograms,
scatter plots, time series plots)
• Classification of data
• Desirable properties of a summary measure
• Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mean, weighted mean, harmonic mean, geometric
mean, Quadratic mean)
• Measures of dispersion (range, Inter quartile range, quartile deviation, variance, standard
deviation)
• Skewness and its measures of skewness (Pearson’s and Bowley’s)
• Kurtosis
• Association between two variables (cross tabulation, Pearson’s product moment correlation
coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient)
• Tables (one way and two-way frequency tables, tables of summary measures)
• Charts (simple and multiple, component, percentage component bar charts, pie charts, pictograms)
• Graphs (line graphs, area graphs)
• Misuse of statistics


## Issues with STA 315 2.0 Essential Skills in Statistics

### Issues with STA 315 2.0 Essential Skills in Statistics


1. Core Statistical Foundations

<p style="color:blue;">~~STA 315 2.0 Essential Skills in Statistics~~</p>


2. Applied and Emerging Areas

<p style="color:blue;">STA 315 2.0 Statistical Thinking and Reasoning</p>


3. Computational and Programming Skills



4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses

<p style="color:blue;">**Suggestions:**</p>

<p style="color:blue;">**Name change to the unit:** as "Statistical Thinking and Reasoning" and and categorize it under tier 2</p>

(Students seem to be mastering statistical procedures and vocabulary but are not able to use statistical reasoning in a meaningful way. This lack of students’ ability to reason and think statistically is of concern.)

## STA 326 2.0 Programming and Data Analysis with R


1. Core Statistical Foundations

2. Applied and Emerging Areas


3. Computational and Programming Skills

<p style="color:blue;">STA 326 2.0 Programming and Data Analysis with R</p>

4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses

**Suggestions**

- Move Section 1 and Section 2 to 2nd year curriculum

##

1. R programming basics: Objects in R, Data types, Operations, Installing packages, Control structures,
Piping

2. Writing functions in R
