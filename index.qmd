2. Applied and Emerging Areas<p style="color:red;">(Third & Fourth Year) </p>


3. Computational and Programming Skills<p style="color:red;">(Throughout the Curriculum)</p>


4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses<p style="color:red;"> (Electives/Third & Final)</p>

##   Issues with STA 113 2.0 and STA 115 1.0

1. Core Statistical Foundations

<p style="color:blue;">STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics</p>

<p style="color:blue;">STA 115 1.0 Elements of Sampling</p>

2. Applied and Emerging Areas

3. Computational and Programming Skills

4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses


###

<p style="color:blue;">**Issue:** Considerable amount of overlaps</p> <p style="color:blue;">**Suggestions:**<p style="color:blue;"> **Remove** "2. Data Collection" from STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics</p>

<p style="color:blue;">**Introduce a new section**: Forms of Data:  Structured Data, Unstructured Data, Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-Temporal</p>

---

STA 113 2.0 Descriptive Statistics

1. **Introduction to Statistics**
• Definition of statistics
• Role of statistics in society
• History of statistics, Branches of statistics
• Scope and limitations of statistics
• Terminology used in statistics

2. **Data Collection**
• Steps of data collection
• Observational and experimental studies
• Primary and secondary data
• Population and sample
• Sampling
• Methods of collecting data


3. **Exploring, Summarization and Presentation of Data**
• Types of data
• Scales of measurements
• Exploring data (one way and two-way frequency tables, box plots, stem and leaf plots, histograms,
scatter plots, time series plots)
• Classification of data
• Desirable properties of a summary measure
• Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mean, weighted mean, harmonic mean, geometric
mean, Quadratic mean)
• Measures of dispersion (range, Inter quartile range, quartile deviation, variance, standard
deviation)
• Skewness and its measures of skewness (Pearson’s and Bowley’s)
• Kurtosis
• Association between two variables (cross tabulation, Pearson’s product moment correlation
coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient)
• Tables (one way and two-way frequency tables, tables of summary measures)
• Data visualisations
• Misuse of statistics

### Issues with STA 315 2.0 Essential Skills in Statistics


1. Core Statistical Foundations

<p style="color:blue;">~~STA 315 2.0 Essential Skills in Statistics~~</p>


2. Applied and Emerging Areas

<p style="color:blue;">STA 315 2.0 Statistical Thinking and Reasoning</p>


3. Computational and Programming Skills



4. Industry Relevance/ Interdisciplinary courses

<p style="color:blue;">**Suggestions:**</p>

<p style="color:blue;">**Name change to the unit:** as "Statistical Thinking and Reasoning" and and categorize it under tier 2</p>

(Students seem to be mastering statistical procedures and vocabulary but are not able to use statistical reasoning in a meaningful way. This lack of students’ ability to reason and think statistically is of concern.)
